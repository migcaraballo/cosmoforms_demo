# CosmoForms Demo

This is a fully integrated demo with backend and database support.

### Setup Requirements

You will need the following to fully run this demo. 

1. **Java 8** - this is the version the demo code is written in, however, any java version will work with CosmoForms since backend technologies aren't tied to the framework.
2. **Tomcat 8** - or any other java server that can run Java 8 and servlet api version 3.1
3. **MongoDB 3.4.X**

Unfortunately, we will not be providing steps on how to set up the above technologies/platforms since that is beyond the scope of this document.
